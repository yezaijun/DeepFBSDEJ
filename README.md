# Deep learning numerical methods for high-dimensional fully nonlinear PIDEs and coupled FBSDEs with jumps

This repository contains the code for the numerical experiments of the paper "Deep learning numerical methods for high-dimensional fully nonlinear PIDEs and coupled FBSDEs with jumps". We provide a minimal implementation of the algorithm to solve both low and high dimensional problems. With reference to existing notebooks, one can easily generalize to other issues.

## Dependencies
Before running the notebook, ensure that PyTorch is installed and the appropriate environment is activated, as the code is written in Jupyter Notebook using the PyTorch backend.
